# Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive **Inventory Management System** developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project. The system is designed to address the challenges faced by our client in managing product inventory and expiration dates effectively. By developing this system, we aim to streamline inventory operations, improve tracking, and ensure the client has up-to-date information on product stock and expiration status.

## Features and Goals
Our primary objectives for this project include the following features:

1. **GUI Inventory**:
   - User-friendly interface for viewing, adding, and managing inventory items.
   - Quick search and filtering options to streamline the management process.

2. **GUI List of Products**:
   - Display all products with essential details like name, quantity, and expiration date.
   - Allow sorting and filtering by categories such as product type, expiration status, and more.

3. **Database System**:
   - A secure and efficient database to store product information, inventory status, and other relevant details.
   - Easy data retrieval and updates to maintain accurate records.

4. **Inventory System**:
   - Track stock levels in real time, automatically updating quantities when items are added or sold.
   - Generate alerts or notifications for low-stock items and upcoming expiration dates.

5. **List System**:
   - Create custom lists based on specific criteria (e.g., products expiring soon, low-stock items).
   - Enable efficient tracking and grouping of items for organized management.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into modules that focus on specific functionalities:
- **Frontend (GUI)**: Built using [mention the library or framework, e.g., JavaFX/Swing if using Java], providing a graphical interface for user interaction.
- **Backend (Inventory and List System)**: Core logic for inventory management, including tracking, categorizing, and handling data for inventory and lists.
- **Database**: Centralized storage using [mention the database being used, e.g., MySQL, SQLite] to maintain data integrity and support smooth data operations.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```

2. **Setup the Database**:
   - Ensure the database is properly configured by [add any specific instructions for setting up the database if needed].

3. **Run the Application**:
   - [Add instructions on how to compile and run the project, especially if it's in Java with command-line instructions or an IDE].
